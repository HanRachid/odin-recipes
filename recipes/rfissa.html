    <h1>Rfissa</h1>

    <h2>With each bite, tons of flavour and spices</h2>
    <p>
        This Atraditionnal Moroccan dish composed of chicken and msemmen drowned in an onion sauce and lentils
    </p>    
    
    <p> 
        The crispiness of the bread added to the wonderful sauce
        and the chicken are a combination that would make anyone fold. Beware of the bread becoming too soggy, as this dish is practically impossible to reheat, it must be eaten as it is served.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large chicken, - quartered or left whole</li>
        <li>3 large onions, - thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tbsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp pepper</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tbsp ginger</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Ras el Hanout - (or 1 1/2 tbsp msakhen)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp turmeric</li>
        <li>1/2 cup uncooked lentils, green or brown</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the pot with the chicken on the stove over medium heat and cook, covered, stirring occasionally, for about 15 to 20 minutes, until a rich sauce has formed. </li>
        <li>Add the drained fenugreek seeds, parsley, cilantro and the water. Cover and simmer over medium-low to medium heat for about 1 hour. Add the drained lentils and continue cooking, covered, for another hour, or until the chicken and lentils are quite tender. 
            
            Add water as needed during cooking to ensure that ample broth remains in the pot, and correct seasoning if necessary.</li>
        <li>Steam the shredded msemen in a couscoussier for about 10 minutes, or until steaming hot and tender. Spread or mound the hot, shredded msemen on a large serving dish. Add the chicken to the bed of msemen, and distribute the lentils, onions and most of the broth over all. R
        eserve a bowlful or two of broth to offer on the side.</li>
        <li>Rfissa is traditionally enjoyed communally from the serving dish, with each person eating from his own side of the plate by hand or with a spoon.</li>
