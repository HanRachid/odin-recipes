    <h2>No need for introduction. A classic and must.</h2>
    <p>
        Although straightforward seeming, boiling an egg has its rules, and it is not forgiving when broken
    </p>    
    
    <p> 
        Even seconds can turn a perfectly runny boiled egg into a hardboiled one. Not that there's anything wrong with the latter, but depending on the dish, the timing must be perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
